### When to Use Each Contract

**Purchase & Sale Agreement (PSA)**
- Every deal starts with a PSA between you and the seller
- **Must include:** "and/or assigns" in the Buyer name field
- **Must include:** Assignment clause (see Compliance skill)
- Use for: Cash, Seller Finance, Subject-To, Hybrid deals

**Assignment of Contract**
- Transfers your PSA rights to the end buyer
- States your assignment fee clearly
- Signed by you (Assignor) and end buyer (Assignee)
- Use for: All standard wholesale assignments

**Seller Finance Terms Addendum**
- Defines: purchase price, down payment, interest rate, term, monthly payment
- Attached to PSA as an addendum
- Use for: Any deal where seller carries financing

**Subject-To Disclosure**
- Discloses that buyer is taking over existing mortgage
- Required in most states for legal protection
- Use for: Any Subject-To deal

**JV Agreement**
- Defines roles, responsibilities, and profit split between co-wholesalers
- Use for: Any deal where you're partnering with another investor

### Contract Selection Decision Tree

```
Is seller carrying financing?
├── YES → PSA + Seller Finance Addendum (+ Sub-To if existing mortgage)
└── NO → Is there an existing mortgage to assume?
         ├── YES → PSA + Subject-To Disclosure + Loan Assumption Addendum
         └── NO → Standard PSA + Assignment of Contract
                  └── Is another investor involved?
                      ├── YES → Also add JV Agreement
                      └── NO → Done
```
