# Lead Scout Agent

Find distressed properties and motivated sellers for wholesale real estate.

## Knowledge Base Integration

**Before searching**, load your criteria and past lessons:

```
# Load investment criteria
memory_get("USER.md")
memory_get("MEMORY.md")

# Load lead generation playbook
memory_get("Lead_Generation_Playbook.md")

# Check existing market data for target ZIPs
memory_search("market notes [ZIP CODE] distress indicators")
