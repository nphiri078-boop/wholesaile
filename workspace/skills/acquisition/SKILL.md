# Acquisition Manager Agent

Contact sellers, negotiate prices, and secure purchase agreements.

## Knowledge Base Integration

**Before every seller call**, query the knowledge base for relevant examples:

```
# Find pitch examples for this deal type
memory_search("seller finance pitch free and clear property")
memory_search("subject to pitch behind on payments")
memory_search("cash offer pitch distressed motivated seller")

# Find objection handling for specific objections
memory_search("seller objection price too low response")
memory_search("seller objection need cash now creative finance")
memory_search("seller objection due on sale clause")

# Find accepted offer examples for confidence
memory_search("outcome accepted subject to deal")
memory_search("outcome accepted seller finance deal")

# Find complex scenario guidance
memory_search("multi-hour negotiation legal complications")
memory_search("negotiation impossible terms restructuring")
```

**After every call**, write lessons to the knowledge base:
```
# Write to: ~/Documents/wholesale-kb/agent-lessons/YYYY-MM-DD-[address].md
# Use the template in agent-lessons/README.md
```

```
memory_get("comprehensive_decision_tree.md")

## Outreach Scripts

### Initial Contact
```
Hi [Name], this is [Your Name]. I saw your property at [Address] 
and I'm interested in buying it. I can close quickly with cash. 
Would you be open to discussing a sale?
```

### Follow-Up (48 hours)
```
Hi [Name], just following up about [Address]. 
I'm still interested and can make a fair cash offer.
```

```
memory_search("initial contact script seller outreach")
memory_search("follow up script seller 48 hours")
memory_search("voicemail script cash offer")

## Seller Qualification Questions

1. "What's your timeline for selling?"
2. "Are there any mortgages or liens on the property?"
3. "What's the property's current condition?"

5. "Have you had any other offers?"

## Objection Handling

When you hit an objection, immediately search:
```
memory_search("seller objection [EXACT OBJECTION WORDS]")

Common objections and where to find responses:
- "Price too low" → `memory_search("objection price too low response technique")`
- "I have an agent" → `memory_search("objection agent commission seller finance")`
- "Need cash now" → `memory_search("objection need cash hybrid deal structure")`
- "Too good to be true" → `memory_search("objection too good to be true trust building")`
- "Due-on-sale" → `memory_search("objection due on sale clause subject to")`

## After the Call

1. Update the deal file in `~/.openclaw/workspace/deals/`
2. Write lessons to `~/Documents/wholesale-kb/agent-lessons/`

# Then search for "STRATEGY REJECTED" section
```

### State-Specific Legal Notes
Subject-To and Trust Acquisition playbooks now have state-specific legal requirements:
```

## TCPA Compliance — Seller Outreach

> **Legal requirement.** Violations carry fines up to $1,500 per message/call.

### Before Any Outreach — Required Checks

**Step 1: Check do-not-contact list**
```
memory_search("do not contact [phone number]")
memory_search("opt out [phone number]")
```
If found → **STOP. Do not contact this number.**

**Step 2: Verify consent exists**
```
memory_search("consent [phone number]")
```
If no consent record → Only contact if they initiated (inbound call/text/mail response).

**Step 3: Confirm contact time**
- Only contact between **8 AM – 9 PM** in the seller's local time zone
- Check seller's address to determine time zone

**Step 4: Prepare opt-out language**
Every outbound text must include: *"Reply STOP to opt out"*

### Consent Types (What Counts as Consent)

| Situation | Consent? | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| Seller called your number | ✅ Yes | Inbound = consent |
| Seller responded to your direct mail | ✅ Yes | Response = consent |
| Seller filled out your web form | ✅ Yes | Form submission = consent |
| Seller's number from a list you bought | ❌ No | Need prior written consent |
| Seller's number from county records | ❌ No | Need prior written consent |
| Seller's number from driving for dollars | ❌ No | Need prior written consent |

### Recording Consent

When a seller provides consent, document it immediately:

```
# Create consent record in knowledge base
# File: ~/Documents/wholesale-kb/consent/YYYY-MM-DD-[phone-last4].md

---
phone: "+15551234567"
source: "direct_mail_response"

```

### Handling Opt-Out Requests

When a seller texts STOP, UNSUBSCRIBE, CANCEL, END, or QUIT:

1. **Immediately** stop all outreach
2. Send confirmation: *"You've been removed from our contact list. We will not contact you again."*
3. Create do-not-contact record:

```
# File: ~/Documents/wholesale-kb/do-not-contact/[phone-last4].md

---
phone: "+15551234567"
opt_out_date: "2026-03-02T14:30:00Z"
opt_out_method: "text"
opt_out_phrase: "STOP"
property: "456 Oak Ave, Atlanta, GA 30310"
---
```

4. Update deal file status to `do_not_contact`
5. **Never contact this number again from any channel**
